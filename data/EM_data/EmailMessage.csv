Our hiring employer support has been tremendous, and grown so much we needed to add Account Managers, such as myself to ensure we communicate with you regularly to learn about new job opportunities and Elite Meet events. Henry and the broader Eiite Meet leadership team will remain very much involved with each of our partners.  As you may recall, we help Special Operation and Fighter Pilot veterans secure great careers with premier organizations. We do not charge veterans to join or employers to hire. Elite Meet is purely a 501(c)(3) non profit supported by donors and sponsors.  Please let me know when you have a moment for a brief call so that I may properly introduce myself and make sure I understand your organization and potential career opportunities. Then let you know about upcoming events in case your organization would like to participate.  I will be happy to share our calendar for upcoming conferences and EMx events, which Henry discussed with you. Shortly, I will also be excited to tell you about our upcoming Elite Meet-Dallas Conference (24-25 July).  Please let me know a good time that works for you. I am in Oahu, Hawaii (minus 4 hours from MST), looking forward to chatting with you.

Our hiring employer support has been tremendous, and grown so much we needed to add Account Managers, such as myself to ensure we communicate with you regularly to learn about new job opportunities and Elite Meet events.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> 						<br /> 						As you may recall, we help Special Operation and Fighter Pilot veterans secure great careers with premier organizations. We do not charge veterans to join or employers to hire. Elite Meet is purely a 501(c)(3) non profit supported by donors and sponsors.&nbsp;<br /> 						<br /> 						I would like to schedule just a brief call with you so that I make sure I understand your organization and potential career opportunities. Then let you know about upcoming events in case your organization would like to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 						<br /> 						I will be happy to share our calendar for upcoming conferences and EMx events.

Our hiring employer support has been tremendous, and grown so much we needed to add Account Managers, such as myself to ensure we communicate with you regularly to learn about new job opportunities and relay information about Elite Meet events. Henry, Sherri, and the broader Elite Meet leadership team will remain very much involved with each of our partners.  As you may recall, we help Special Operation and Fighter Pilot veterans secure great careers with premier organizations. We do not charge veterans to join or employers to hire. Elite Meet is purely a 501(c)(3) non profit supported by donors and sponsors.  Please let me know when you have a moment for a brief call so that I may properly introduce myself and make sure I understand your organization and potential career opportunities. I'd also like to inform you about upcoming events in case your organization would like to participate.  Please let me know a good time that works for you next week.

Please let me know when you have a moment for a brief call so that I may properly introduce myself and make sure I understand your organization and potential career opportunities.

Would you or your teammates have any issues if we recorded our session? We do so to ensure widest distro for folks that can't attend, so if anyone has druthers please let me know.  A few of the things I promised, below is a generic agenda for your consideration, by no means is it firm so please feel free to adjust as needed. And 2nd, attached is our EM-Dallas flyer for your consideration, we hope you or your team will be able to attend.  I'll send our community demographics in a follow-up email (sorry for spamming your inbox) so you have context for what the Elite Meet veteran community looks like as a run-up to the webinar.  Draft agenda: Pre webinar: read ahead / fact sheet (company to EM; EM to VF), VF bios, vet bios (if registered early)  Webinar (~1 hour total): - Intros (name, job, location) - (handoff to VF) VF orientation - Culture - Possible / historical veteran roles in VFC - Application process - Current priority fills / locations  Q&A (min 15min) - sample jobs - senior/mid manager to executive - right fit (have example handy - fighter pilot +10yr/ SOF vet 10-15+yr)? - What are your challenges hiring veterans? Or veterans fitting in? - Right candidate profile? What do you look for in hiring at manager, senior manager, and executive positions  If there's anything, please let me know. Thanks again for your support and patience! Hope you have a good Memorial Day weekend!

My name is Nick Creasey and I am your new Account Manager at Elite Meet. Our hiring employer support has been tremendous, and grown so much we needed to add Account Managers, such as myself to ensure we communicate with you regularly to learn about new job opportunities and relay information about Elite Meet events. Henry and the broader Elite Meet leadership team will remain very much involved with each of our partners.  As you may recall, we help Special Operation and Fighter Pilot veterans secure great careers with premier organizations. We do not charge veterans to join or employers to hire. Elite Meet is purely a 501(c)(3) non profit supported by donors and sponsors.  Please let me know when you have a moment for a brief call next week so that I may properly introduce myself and make sure I understand your organization and potential career opportunities. I'd also like to inform you about upcoming events in case your organization would like to participate.  Please let me know a good time that works for you next week. I am looking forward to chatting with you. Have a great Memorial Day Weekend.
